    <h3>Ella Enchanted</h3>
    <p>The movie was really interesting, I learnt interesting things about love, patience and kindness.</p>
    <h3>Home</h3>
    <p>Home is an amazing animation movie for kids, one of the stricking momennts was when Oh came back so he could save his friend.</p>
    <h3>Merlin</h3>
    <p>Though it's not a movie per sa, it's series. My best characters were Author, Merlin and Gwen. They made the whole experience amazing.</p>
